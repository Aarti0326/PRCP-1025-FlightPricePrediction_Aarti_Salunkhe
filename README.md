# PRCP-1025-FlightPricePrediction_Aarti_Salunkhe
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict flight ticket prices based on key factors such as airline, departure time, travel duration, number of stops, and seasonality. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms, this model helps both travelers and airlines make data-driven pricing decisions.
